A collection of tools for navigating websites across borders, starting with currency and unit conversion utilities.

I built this for myself while living between countries. I needed an easy way to compare prices between INR and USD without constantly using a calculator. 

I'm also going to need help with unit conversions. For example, cm to inches, kg to lbs, and Fahrenheit to Celsius.. etc etc.

## What's Included

### [Chrome Extension - Currency Converter](./chrome-extension/)

A browser extension that automatically detects prices on web pages and shows currency conversions on hover. Useful when shopping online and comparing prices between countries.

**Features:**
- Detects INR and USD prices automatically
- Shows converted prices on hover
- Live exchange rates (cached for 24 hours)
- Works on Amazon and other e-commerce sites
- Optional manual rate override

See the [chrome-extension README](./chrome-extension/README.md) for installation instructions.

## Planned Tools

- Unit converter (cm/inches, kg/lbs, temperatures)
- Firefox extension
- Safari extension
