# Deported Kit

A kit for people who have been deported or are navigating life across borders. These tools help with everyday challenges like understanding foreign prices, converting units. 

I'm building this for myself first, I've been deported to India from the United States. So, I need help calculating the price of things from INR to USD.

For example, if I see a price of 100 INR on a website, I want to know how much that is in USD. Keeping the iOS calculator open in currency conversion mode is not that much fun.
